<p><b>Frames</b></p>
<p>Setting up the joint constraint frames is the first step in successfully configuring a joint. A frame marks a position and orientation in space. It is viewed as a set of three right angle axes meeting at a point that is considered the origin of the frame.</p>
<p>The d6joint uses a pair of frames, one fixed in the world and one fixed in the constrained body. The frame locations are specified by their fixed offset relative to their respective actor frame (or the world frame).</p>
<p>A common way to specify 6 DOF frame offsets in computer graphics is as 4x4 homogeneous rigid body transformation matrices that contain both the position offset of the origin and the rotational offset of the frame as a 3x3 submatrix. In the AGEIA PhysX SDK, joint frames are specified using an anchor point and a pair of unit vectors which represent the joint frames orientation relative to the body frames. The third axis can be derived from the other two axes since they are orthogonal, where the z-axis is computed as a cross product of x and y (see the diagram in the 6-Degree-of-Freedom Configurable Joint section).</p>
<p>The x-axis is the principal axis in a d6joint frame for the purposes of a twist and swing decomposition of the joint's rotation; an arbitrary orientation is achieved by (1) a twist rotation about the x-axis followed by (2) a swing rotation about an axis in the yz plane.</p>
<p><b>Parent and Child Constraint Frames</b> Using the parent/child naming conventions, the first frame is the parent, corresponding to actor[0] and the second frame is the child, corresponding to actor[1]. Usually the parent frame is fixed in the world or located in the limb that is closer to the central root in a hierarchy, but this is not enforced.</p>
<p>The principal axis of the child frame will usually be aligned with the symmetry axis of its actor (e.g., the long axis of a limb or the rotation axis of a wheel). The principal axis of the parent frame is used to specify the center of a swing limit so should be set in the middle range of motion of the child limb.</p>
<p>The y and z axes provide a reference for the twist rotation of the principal axis between parent and child. The y and z axes of the parent frame are also used for aligning an optional swing limit.</p>
<p><b>Drive Frames</b></p>
<p>When driving the joint it can be useful to imagine a third drive frame specified by the drive position input – an offset from the parent constraint frame. Drive velocities are specified relative to the parent joint frame.</p>
<p><b>Frame Relationship Summary</b></p>
<p>By now there are six frames involved, including the world frame and the actor frames but ignoring other frames such as the center of mass frames which are not directly involved with the joint configuration. There is plenty of scope for confusion if it is not clear how frame offsets are being specified or what conventions are being used.</p>
<p>Note that once the joint constraint frames have been set up, as above, at some (fixed) offset from their respective actor body frames then the actor body frames can be forgotten; their position and alignment has no effect on the action of the joint, only the constraint frames are involved in the operation of the joint.</p>
<p>The following sketch shows the relative frame offsets as they are stored and treated by the d6joint.</p>

</div>
<p>The joint frames are sketched separate from each other for clarity, but the joint constraints will act to bring the two constraint frames together and drive constraints will act to bring the drive frame and the child frame together.</p>
<p>The AGEIA PhysX SDK allows for frame setup in global coordinates (i.e., relative to the world frame or absolute). A single global frame position and orientation can be used to initialize both constraint frames. This can be convenient in simple cases when the actors are in suitable starting positions; however, for more complex cases, like setting up rag doll joint limits, parent and child frames are best set up separately.</p>
<p>The pJoint::setGlobalAnchor() and pJoint::setGlobalAxis() functions are used to set the frame position and orientation in the global frame (remember when using setGlobalAxis() that the x-axis is the principle axis for a d6joint, unlike other joints).</p>
<h3>D6Joint Coordinates </h3>
<p>For specifying position constraints, it is useful to think of the joint's 6DOF as being parameterized by six coordinates, three linear and three angular, between the constraint frame fixed in the parent actor and the constraint frame fixed in the child actor.</p>
<p>For the angular DOFs, the concept of ‘twist and swing’ is used to structure the API for specifying angular joint types and limits and to actually implement the default angular drive behavior so that twist and swing freedoms are decoupled.</p>
<p><b>Linear Coordinates: Cartesian X, Y, Z </b> The three linear DOFs are uncomplicated; they are naturally specified by the three Cartesian origin coordinates of the child frame in the parent frame. Similarly, the drive frame position is specified by Cartesian coordinates relative to the parent frame, and the velocity components are simply derivatives of the position coordinates.</p>
<p><b>Default Angular Coordinates: Twist &amp; Swing</b></p>
<p>Twist and swing coordinates are the default angular coordinates for the d6joint. They decouple a 3D rotation into a 1D twist rotation about the principal frame axis and a swing rotation about an axis in the orthogonal plane of the two remaining frame axes.</p>
<p>Twist and swing coordinates have a singularity; when the child limb swings a full 180 degrees so that its principal axis points in exactly the reverse direction of the parent’s principal axis, the limb’s twist is not defined. Avoid this singularity; limits should be used when a zero-twist joint is configured or when driving a ball-and-socket joint with the default twist and swing coordinates.</p>
<p>This intuitive idea of twist and swing is all that is needed to configure joints and limits. More details are given in the Angular Drives section. </p>
