By default, all components are selected when you first launch the Virtools installation 
program. However, the full install takes up a fair amount of space (c. 1 GB), and may include 
components that you do not at the moment need, such as export plugins and sample files, so you 
may have decided to install only some components.

To add or re-install any components, simply insert the Virtools DVD, select  "Virtools" 
in the installation program once more, and only select the components you want to install.
