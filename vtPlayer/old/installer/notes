1. install the installer module for vc2003
2. add a new project to the solution :
  "Setup and Deployment Projects" -> "Setup Project"
3. Right click on the project created and : 
    -> "add Project Output"
    -> choose "cs-runner" ( Primary Output )
    -> in the solution folder you should find now under "Detected Dependencies" :
        "dotnetfxredist_x86.msm"
4. correct the rest of the projects properties


I have a InstallShield-Express11 Version. Its a black one. I can upload it when you want. 
- allows skins
- is integrated in viusal studio
- allows a lot of customization or adding other merge modules.
- pretty nice !
