//! Extrapolator maintains state about updates for remote entities, and 
//! will generate smooth guesses about where those entities will be 
//! based on previously received data.
//! 
//! You create one Extrapolator per quantity you want to interpolate. 
//! Arguments include the type to interpolate (works best with float 
//! or double), and how many values/axes (typically 3 for positions).
//!
//! You then feed it updates about where your entity was ("positions") 
//! at some point in time. Optionally, you can also give the Extrapolator
//! information about the velocity at that point in time.
//! After that, you can ask the Extrapolator for position values for 
//! some given real time. Optionally, you can also ask for the velocity 
//! at the same time.
//!
//! The Extrapolator will assume that an entity stops in place if it 
//! hasn't received updates for some time about the entity. It will also 
//! keep a running estimate of the latency and frequency of updates.
//!
//! Extrapolator requires a globally synchronized clock. It does not do 
//! any management to deal with clock skew (that is the subject of a 
//! separate class).
