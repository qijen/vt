<h1><a class="anchor" name="history">History of the Torque Network Library</a></h1>Near the end of 1997, a team of developers at Dynamix were hard at work on a new, network only game that would push the requirements of internet gaming technology to a new level. Starsiege: TRIBES allowed up to 32 players to compete in seamless indoor and outdoor areas with futuristic weapons, jet packs and vehicles.<p>
Unlike other games at the time that were limited to tight indoor environments, the TRIBES environment posed a more difficult set of networking problems. Because of their open nature, clients in the game could often see most of the other players, along with a large number of projecticles and simulated vehicles, turrets and other objects. Also, given the state of most internet connections at the time, it was decided that TRIBES must run well even over a 28.8 kbps modem, imposing a meager 2 Kbytes per second of bandwidth limitation on each client.<p>
With these requirements in mind, Mark Frohnmayer, Rick Overman and Tim Gift designed a network architecture that would maximize the information value of every bit transmitted over the network, and created a new "Notify" protocol that harnessed the unreliable nature of the network transport medium to eliminate unnecessary retransmission of information.<p>
The Tribes Network Architecture was further refined during the development of Tribes 2 to server more players (up to 100 in a single gaming area served by a 1GHz Pentium III) and save even more packet data space, introducing the concept of a network string table and only periodic control object state updating during client-side prediction.<p>
When the Tribes 2 engine became GarageGames' Torque Game Engine, additional iterative improvements were made, including checksums on client state data and a new network interface class to encapsulate the connection startup and prevent connection depletion Denial-of-Service attacks.<p>
The final step in the history of the Torque Network Library was to refactor its constituent parts into a standalone network technology that didn't require any other components from the Torque Game Engine. As a part of this process, significant library structural improvements were made; every class and class member were documented, and strong encryption support was added. Other new features include a simple and powerful Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism, client puzzles for protecting servers from server CPU depletion Denial-of-Service attacks, and 3rd-party negotiated direct connections to connect clients behind firewalls and NAT (Network <a class="el" href="structTNL_1_1Address.html" title="Representation of a network address.">Address</a> Translation) routers, making <a class="el" href="namespaceTNL.html" title="Global namespace for all TNL classes.">TNL</a> a robust, full-featured, secure networking solution for a wide variety of applications. 			<div class="footer">
